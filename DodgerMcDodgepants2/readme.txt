Dodger McDodgePants IV 2
Well, Well...Here we are again.

You say you want more? Well...I'm not surprised.

You know the drill.
You are Dodger, a square possessing a massive...

uhm...err...you got skills.

Anyway you gotta collect coins, but this time it is a bit different than you remember.

Collect 9001 coins and you win...That's right! It's over 9000!!!!

However, this time I have added a few powerups.
These will cause you to move so fast your enemies look like they are standing still, increase score from coin pickups, or allow you to hide in plane sight(But don't get any ideas about peeping on the girl next door...perv)

Also, be on guard...your enemies may attempt an ambush as a last ditch effor to eliminate you!!!

Good Luck Dodger, and, as always, may the shwartz be with you.
